# House Prices Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand the relationship between house features and how these variables can be used to predict house prices using statistical analysis and deep learning models.

## Objective

- Predict house prices using two different models.
- Minimize the difference between predicted and actual prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Kaggle KC House Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction).

## Models Used

1. **Multiple Linear Regression**
2. **Keras Deep Learning Model**
3. **Bayesian Ridge Regression**
